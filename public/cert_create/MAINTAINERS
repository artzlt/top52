variables and added support for accessing object fields in template
(using get() method of the object) like {Object.field}

-- Added define blocs which parsed in condition with defining some specified parse variable
-- Added include block which include another template by statement (like SSI do)
<!--#include file="include2.html"-->
It is usefull if you have several different templates for different
parts of page and you dont need to write any php code to gather all "blocks" of the page
Also is very helpfull from designer point of view, he will see in a visual editor te result.

 -- used str_replace instead of ereg_replace, this latest is not installed
on a lot of servers and give out error.
 -- added Pattern Assign - when variables or constants are the same as the
template keys, these functions may be used as they are. Using these functions,
can help you reduce the number of the assign functions in the php files, very
useful for language files
 -- get_magic_quotes_gpc() problem on some servers are fixed. Seems that some
servers not read magic quotes correcttly and template files are messed up.
